=head1 NAME

Text::Tradition::Parser::CollateX

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parser module for Text::Tradition, given a GraphML file from the
CollateX program that describes a collation graph.  For further
information on the GraphML format for text collation, see
http://gregor.middell.net/collatex/

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<parse>

parse( $graph, $graphml_string );

Takes an initialized Text::Tradition::Graph object and a string
containing the GraphML; creates the appropriate nodes and edges on the
graph.
